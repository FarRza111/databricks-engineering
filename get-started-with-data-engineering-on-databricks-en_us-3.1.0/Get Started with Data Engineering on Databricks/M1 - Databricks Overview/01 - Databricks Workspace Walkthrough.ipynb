    "\n",
    "In this walkthrough, we will be covering several key components of the Databricks workspace, including:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Explore the Databricks Workspace Homepage** and understand its usefulness for high-level navigation.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Utilize the navigation panel** to switch between various Databricks features. \n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Inspect and change user settings**.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Execute the Classroom Setup** for all the demos and labs.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Navigate Workspace assets and objects**, where we will look into how to efficiently move through different areas of the Databricks interface.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Work with notebooks**, where we will go over how to create, edit, and run code in notebooks.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Unity Catalog and Catalog Explorer**, covering how to assign and manage permissions for different users and groups to ensure secure access to data in addition to how to locate various assets registered to Unity Catalog. \n",
    "\n",
    "1. **(Optional) Compute**, going over how to use the UI to create a new cluster. \n",
